## Development Environment Setup

1. **Required Tools**
   - Flutter SDK (latest stable version)
   - Android Studio / VS Code
   - Git
   - Node.js (for some development scripts)

2. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mobile-app.git
   cd mobile-app

   # Install Flutter dependencies
   flutter pub get

   # Setup pre-commit hooks
   ./scripts/setup-hooks.sh
   ```

## Branching Strategy

We follow a modified Git Flow strategy:

- `main` - Production branch
- `develop` - Development branch
- `feature/*` - New features
- `bugfix/*` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix/*` - Urgent production fixes
- `release/*` - Release preparation

### Branch Naming Convention

- Feature branches: `feature/JIRA-123-short-description`
- Bug fixes: `bugfix/JIRA-456-short-description`
- Hotfixes: `hotfix/JIRA-789-short-description`

## Development Workflow

1. **Start New Feature**
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/JIRA-123-feature-name
   ```

2. **Regular Development**
   - Write code following our [Coding Standards](CODING_STANDARDS.md)
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Commit Changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature description"
   ```

4. **Keep Branch Updated**
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git rebase origin/develop
   ```

5. **Push Changes**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/JIRA-123-feature-name
   ```

## Testing Guidelines

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Required for all new features
   - Minimum 80% coverage
   ```bash
   flutter test
   ```

2. **Widget Tests**
   - Required for all UI components
   ```bash
   flutter test test/widget_test
   ```

3. **Integration Tests**
   - Required for major features
   ```bash
   flutter drive --target=test_driver/app.dart
   ```

## Code Review Process

1. **Before Review**
   - Run all tests
   - Update documentation
   - Self-review your changes
   - Ensure CI passes

2. **Review Requirements**
   - At least two approvals required
   - All comments must be resolved
   - CI must pass
   - Documentation updated

3. **After Review**
   - Squash commits if needed
   - Rebase on develop
   - Delete feature branch after merge

## Release Process

1. **Prepare Release**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b release/v1.2.3
   # Update version numbers
   git commit -m "chore: bump version to 1.2.3"
   ```

2. **Testing**
   - Full regression testing
   - Performance testing
   - Security scanning

3. **Release**
   - Merge to main
   - Tag release
   - Deploy to production

## Continuous Integration

- Build verification
- Automated testing
- Code quality checks
- Release automation

## Monitoring and Metrics
